##Â ReacTex: using React Native and Neural Networks to recognize handwritten equations

You cannot hardcode every rule!  Can't just sprinkle in a bunch of if statements...

DL looks pretty cool, but how do I start learning?

1) Start using APIs!  Watson, Googele Cloud (vision and speech recognition, video intelligence)
2) Do it yourself!  Try little projects
3) Learning materials:
  - Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree
  - Coursera Andrew Ng Deep Learning

Tensorflow is really good if you know what you're doing.  If you don't, Keras might be better.

Latex is an equation editor.
